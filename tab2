Use Ramda to Optimize Front-End Code (vs Lodash)
ðŸŽ¯ Context

In our front-end development, we often rely on utility libraries to:

Manipulate arrays and objects.

Chain data transformations.

Write concise and readable code.

Historically, Lodash has been very popular. However, Ramda offers significant advantages that make our code more functional, maintainable, and optimized.

| Aspect           | Lodash                       | Ramda                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Paradigm**     | Imperative/Object-oriented   | 100% functional and immutable                              |
| **Immutability** | Partial (mutable by default) | Immutable by default                                       |
| **Currying**     | Limited (via `_.curry`)      | Native and consistent                                      |
| **Chaining**     | Wrapper-based (`_.chain`)    | Direct function composition (`R.pipe`, `R.compose`)        |
| **Readability**  | Good but often verbose       | Highly readable and expressive for complex transformations |
| **Bundle Size**  | Heavier in some cases        | Lighter and more tree-shaking friendly                     |


Concrete Example



âœ… Key Advantages of Ramda

Consistent functional style: All functions are curried and accept data as the last argument.

Immutable by default: Reduces side effects and potential bugs.

Better composition: R.pipe and R.compose simplify complex pipelines.

Efficient tree-shaking: Keeps bundle sizes smaller by importing only whatâ€™s needed.

Improved readability: Code becomes more declarative and easier to test.
